# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Prabh's Personal Finance Manager

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A personal expense tracker that has different catagories in which you can calculate total expenses

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

When I did this in real life, I had 5 total categories: income, savings, food, entertainment, and gas. The software will allow me to enter my income and enter what percentage of each of the other 4 categories my money goes to. I can enter or deduct money from each category. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not sure

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Only myself

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to get at least a 80 on this grade.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to get at least an 90 on this grade.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to get at least an 95 on this grade.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to devote more time out of my day/week to think about the project. I do have multiple classes like evryone else, so I cannot fall behind.
